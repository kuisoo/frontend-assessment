## Introduction

Hello I am Cris Marc Anading, and this is my exam submission for the frontend developer position. I used NextJS, Tailwind, and Typescript CSS because this is the setup I am most comfortable with right now.

##### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kuisoo/frontend-assessment.git`
2. Go to the new clone repository and install the packages: `npm install`
3. Run the app: `npm run dev`
4. The app will be running in localhost:3000

## Exercise 1

- Exercise 1 will be in the root URL (localhost:3000)

## Exercise 2

- Exercise 2 will be in the URL (localhost:3000/exercise-2)

###### Bonus points

- Explain why the result of `('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase()` is `banana`.
- Answer: Grouping the expression would give ('b' + 'a' + (+'a') + 'a') which gives a result of 'baNaNa' since the expression (+'a') will return NaN (Not a Number). Turning all to lowercase will return 'banana'

## NOTE: For easier navigation there is a floating button at the bottom right of the browser if you want to go to the other Exercise
